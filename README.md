Classification of Quality of Wine using Logistic Regression

1) Executed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data with 12 columns and nearly 5000 rows using ggplot2
2) Removed multicollinearity in the dataset by omitting the variable with the maximum Variance Inflation Factor
3) Developed a Multiple Logistic Regression Model after removing insignificant numerical variables from the model
4) Attained an Accuracy of 69.36%, Precision of 82.21% and an F1 score of 75.5% on the testing data
5) Plotted the ROC curve and obtained an area under curve of 0.763 by using threshold probability of 0.6309
